This plan is too generic. Do NOT start coding yet.

Using the full instructions from byov_refactor_prompt_full.txt, expand this into a detailed, ordered task list with explicit file names, function names, and routes. Treat your current bullets as section headers only.

Your expanded plan must include, at minimum:

Creating dashboard_sync.py and moving the existing dashboard sync logic into exactly three functions: pull_dashboard_data(), push_to_dashboard(record), and push_dashboard_update(updated_record) without changing any payload shapes, endpoints, or business logic.

Creating enrollment_app.py as the technician-facing app, calling st.set_page_config(page_title="Sears BYOV Enrollment", layout="wide") once at the top, and moving the entire enrollment workflow there (lookup, VIN decode, vehicle selection, MPG logic, signatures, PDF, email, final submission) and wiring it to push_to_dashboard(technician_record).

Creating admin_app.py as the admin app, calling st.set_page_config(page_title="BYOV Admin Dashboard", layout="wide") once at the top, and moving all admin-only features there (login, technician list, editing/status updates, surveys, SMS, recycle bin, audit log, PDF review), using pull_dashboard_data() and push_dashboard_update(updated_record).

Implementing an inject_admin_theme_css() helper in admin_app.py that loads byov-preferred.html via st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True) and calling it after successful login and before rendering the main dashboard UI.

Updating the Node/Express server to start two Streamlit processes (enrollment_app.py on port 8000 and admin_app.py on port 8001) and configuring proxy routing for /enroll and /admin with full HTTP + WebSocket support.

Updating only the landing page buttons so Technician Enrollment → /enroll and Admin Control Center → /admin without changing layout or styling.

Marking byov_app.py as legacy-only with a comment and ensuring nothing imports or uses it.

Cleaning up unused imports and then walking through a final verification checklist covering the enrollment app, admin app, and infrastructure/routing to confirm that no business logic or data contracts have changed.

Produce this as a numbered, step-by-step execution plan (with substeps where needed) and show it to me BEFORE making any file changes.
