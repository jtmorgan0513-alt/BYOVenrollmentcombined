You are working on my BYOV landing page repo.
There is a mileage/earnings calculator component on the landing page – the one that shows things like:

Rate: $0.57/mile

Potential Annual Earnings

Weekly Reimbursement

Est. Gas Cost

Est Net Weekly Payout

Weekly Miles slider

Vehicle MPG, Gas Price inputs

VIN input to auto-detect MPG

Goal: Clean up the visual layout so it feels calm and modern, without changing any of the actual calculations, props, state, or API calls. This is a pure UI/UX refactor.

Find the calculator component and styles

Locate the React/JSX/TSX component that renders this calculator on the landing page.

Identify the CSS/Tailwind/styling used for it.

Keep all functionality exactly the same

Do not change how values are calculated.

Do not rename props, state variables, or functions unless strictly necessary.

Do not remove any existing inputs or outputs.

The slider, VIN lookup, and all current behaviors must continue to work exactly as they do now.

Restructure the layout to be calmer and more minimal (Apple-style)

Use a single clean card with generous padding and rounded corners (e.g. border-radius 16–20px) and a soft shadow.

Remove unnecessary horizontal separators/lines unless they really help readability.

Layout order should be:

Header section (top):

Left: “Earnings Calculator” and the rate text.

Right: “Potential Annual Earnings” with the annual earnings value as the primary focus (large bold number).

Inputs section (middle):

First row: “Your state” dropdown (full width on mobile, half width or inline on desktop).

Second row: “Weekly miles” slider with value clearly shown to the right (e.g. “900 mi”).

Third row: two equal-width fields side by side: “Vehicle MPG” and “Gas price”.

Fourth row: VIN input with search icon/button, full width.

Results section (bottom):

A subtle container or light background area that shows:

Weekly Reimbursement

Est. Gas Cost

Est Net Weekly Payout (make this the main number in this section; use slightly larger font).

Optionally show the annual earnings again here in smaller text, but the main big number for annual earnings stays in the header.

Visual style rules

Use the existing design system where possible (same fonts and primary color), but:

Increase font size and weight for key numbers (weekly net and annual earnings).

Use consistent spacing: 16–24px vertical spacing between groups, 8–12px between labels and fields.

Use a single primary accent color for sliders, highlights, and the annual earnings number; avoid multiple competing colors that make it feel busy.

Make the negative gas cost red but subtle, not screaming.

Ensure alignment is clean: labels left-aligned, values right-aligned where appropriate.

Implementation details

Respect the existing styling approach. If the project uses Tailwind, modify Tailwind classes. If it uses CSS modules or styled-components, update those instead of introducing a new styling system.

Make sure the component is fully responsive:

On mobile: stack everything in a single column and keep it scrollable but compact.

On desktop: use two columns where it makes sense (e.g., header values on the right, inputs/results beneath).

Remove any leftover unused styles or class names related only to the old layout.

Verification

After changes, run the app and confirm:

All inputs work as before.

Slider still updates values.

VIN lookup still works.

All numbers (weekly reimbursement, gas cost, net weekly payout, annual earnings) still update correctly when inputs change.

Finally, show me the updated component code and any CSS/Tailwind changes you made, and briefly summarize the layout changes so I know what you touched.
